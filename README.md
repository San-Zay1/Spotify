## Overview
This project involves working with a Spotify dataset that contains information about songs, albums, and artists. The main tasks include organizing the dataset into a structured format, writing SQL queries (easy, medium, and advanced), and analyzing the data to find useful insights. The goal is to improve SQL skills and understand trends in the music industry.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.

## 15 Practice Questions

### Easy Level
1. **Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.**
```
Select 
track 
from spotify 
where stream>1000000;
```
2. **List all albums along with their respective artists.**
```
select 
distinct artist,
album 
from spotify;
```
3. **Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed = TRUE`.**
```
select 
sum(comments) as 'Total_number_of_comments' 
from spotify 
where licensed='True';
```
4. **Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.**
```
select 
distinct track 
from spotify 
where album_type='single';
```
5. **Count the total number of tracks by each artist.**
```
select 
artist,
count(*) as 'Total_number_of_tracks' 
from spotify 
group by artist;
```

### Medium Level
1. **Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.**
```
Select 
album,
avg(danceability) as 'Average_danceability' 
from spotify 
group by album;
```
3. **Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.**
```
select 
track,
max(energy) 
from spotify 
group by track 
limit 5;
```
5. **List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.**
```
select 
track,
sum(views) as 'total_views',
sum(likes) as 'total_likes' 
from spotify 
where official_video='true' 
group by track;
```
7. **For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.**
```
select 
distinct album,
sum(views) as 'total_views' 
from spotify 
group by album;
```
9. **Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.**
```
With streamed as (
select track,
coalesce(sum(case when most_playedon='spotify' then stream end),0) as 'Total_spotify_streamed',
coalesce(sum(case when most_playedon='youtube' then stream end),0) as 'Total_youtube_streamed'
from spotify
group by track
)
select track,
Total_spotify_streamed,
Total_youtube_streamed 
from streamed 
where Total_spotify_streamed>Total_youtube_streamed 
and Total_youtube_streamed<>0;
```

### Advanced Level
1. **Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.**
```sql
With mostviewdtracks as (
select artist,
track,
views,
dense_rank() over(partition by artist order by views desc) as 'Most_viewed_tracks' 
from spotify
)
select * 
from mostviewdtracks 
where Most_viewed_tracks<=3;
```
2. **Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.**
```sql
select 
distinct track 
from spotify 
where liveness>
(select avg(liveness) from spotify);
```
 
3. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**
```sql
With energydifference as (
select 
album,
max(energy) as 'Highest_energy',
min(energy) as 'Lowest_energy'
from spotify
group by album
)
select album,
Highest_energy-Lowest_energy as 'Energy_differences' 
from energydifference 
order by Highest_energy desc;
```
